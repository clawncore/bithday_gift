# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue Summary
The Vercel deployment is failing with the error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/var/task/server/routes' imported from /var/task/server/vercel.js
```

## Root Cause Analysis
This error indicates that the Vercel deployment is still trying to import the [routes.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/server/routes.ts) module, which doesn't exist in the deployed environment.

## Current State
1. **vercel.ts** - Simplified to remove all dependencies that could cause issues
2. **vercel.json** - Correctly configured to use vercel.ts as the entry point
3. **API functions** - Using serverless functions in the [api](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/api) directory

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Clear Vercel Cache
Sometimes Vercel caches old build artifacts that can cause issues:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to the "Settings" tab
4. Click on "Git" in the sidebar
5. Scroll down to "Ignored Build Step" and temporarily add a command to force a rebuild
6. Alternatively, you can delete the existing deployment and redeploy

### 2. Verify GitHub Repository
Make sure your GitHub repository is up to date:
1. Commit all changes locally
2. Push to GitHub
3. Verify that the [server/vercel.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/server/vercel.ts) file in GitHub doesn't contain any references to routes.ts
4. Verify that the [server/index.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/server/index.ts) file is not being referenced in the Vercel build

### 3. Check Vercel Build Logs
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to the "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the latest deployment
5. Check the build logs for any errors
6. Look specifically for any references to routes.ts or index.ts

### 4. Verify File Structure
Make sure your file structure in the deployed environment is correct:
```
- api/
  - authenticate.js
  - claim.js
  - get-replies.js
  - reply.js
- server/
  - vercel.ts
- client/
  - dist/
- vercel.json
```

### 5. Test Locally
Before deploying, test locally:
1. Run `npm run build` to build the client
2. Make sure there are no errors during the build process

## If Issues Persist
If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check for Hidden References**: Search your entire codebase for any references to routes.ts or registerRoutes that might be causing the issue

2. **Simplify Further**: Consider removing the vercel.ts file entirely and only using the serverless functions

3. **Contact Vercel Support**: If none of the above steps work, there might be an issue with the Vercel build environment that requires support intervention

## Next Steps
1. Commit the simplified vercel.ts file
2. Push to GitHub
3. Trigger a new Vercel deployment
4. Monitor the build logs for any errors
5. Test the deployed application
