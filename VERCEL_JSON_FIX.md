# Vercel.json Fix

## Issue
The vercel.json file had two problems:
1. It was missing the closing brace `}` which caused a JSON parsing error
2. There was an encoding issue that was causing validation problems

## Solution
I've recreated the vercel.json file with the correct content and proper formatting:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/**/*.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/$1.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/$1",
      "methods": ["GET"]
    },
    {
      "src": "/",
      "dest": "/dist/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Changes
1. Added the missing closing brace `}` at the end of the file
2. Ensured proper JSON formatting with correct indentation
3. Maintained the routing rules that should fix the 404 error:
   - API routes are directed to serverless functions
   - All GET requests are served from the dist directory
   - The root path specifically serves dist/index.html

## Expected Result
After deploying with this corrected vercel.json file, the application should:
- Build successfully without JSON parsing errors
- Load the homepage without 404 errors
- Properly handle all client-side routing
- Successfully process API requests
