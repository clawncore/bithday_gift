# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Analysis
The application was showing a "404 Not Found" error when deployed to Vercel:
`GET https://bithday-gift.vercel.app/ 404 (Not Found)`

## Root Cause
The issue was with the routing configuration in vercel.json. While the build process was correctly outputting files to the `dist` directory, the routing configuration wasn't properly handling the root path.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated vercel.json Routing Configuration
Added explicit routing rules to ensure proper handling of all requests:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/$1.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/$1",
      "methods": ["GET"]
    },
    {
      "src": "/",
      "dest": "/dist/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration ensures:
- API requests are properly routed to serverless functions
- All GET requests are served from the dist directory
- The root path specifically serves dist/index.html

### 2. Verified Build Configuration
Confirmed that:
- package.json build scripts correctly execute `cd client && vite build`
- client/vite.config.ts outputs to the root `dist` directory
- All necessary static files are generated in the dist directory

### 3. Tested Build Process
Successfully tested the build process which outputs:
- index.html in the root of dist directory
- All CSS and JS assets in dist/assets directory

## How It Works Now
1. Vercel runs the `vercel-build` script during deployment
2. This builds the React frontend application to the root `dist` directory
3. The routing configuration serves static files from the `dist` directory
4. API requests are routed to serverless functions in the `/api` directory
5. The root path serves index.html, enabling client-side routing

## Expected Result
After deploying these changes, the application should:
- Load the homepage without 404 errors
- Properly handle all client-side routing
- Successfully process API requests
- Display all content correctly

This fix addresses the core routing issue that was preventing the application from loading properly on Vercel.
