# Final Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
The application was showing a "404 Not Found" error when deployed to Vercel because of incorrect build and routing configuration.

## Root Cause
The main issue was that Vercel was trying to build and serve the application incorrectly:
1. Build process was not properly configured to run from the correct directory
2. Static file serving was pointing to the wrong directory
3. API routes were not properly configured

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated package.json
- Kept the build command as `cd client && vite build` to ensure building happens in the correct directory
- Added `vercel-build` script that does the same thing for Vercel deployment

### 2. Updated vercel.json
- Configured the build to use `@vercel/static-build` with the correct `distDir` pointing to `client/dist`
- Set up proper routing for API endpoints to use `@vercel/node`
- Configured static file serving to correctly point to the built React app in `client/dist`

### 3. Verified Build Process
- Confirmed that the build command works correctly from the root directory
- Verified that files are correctly built to `client/dist` directory
- Confirmed that `index.html` and other static assets are properly generated

## How It Works Now

1. Vercel runs the `vercel-build` script during deployment
2. This script changes to the client directory and builds the React frontend application
3. The build output goes to `client/dist` directory
4. The static build configuration serves these files from the `client/dist` directory
5. API requests are routed to the appropriate serverless functions in the `/api` directory
6. All routes that don't match API endpoints serve the React application, enabling client-side routing

## Key Configuration Details

### package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cd client && vite build",
    "vercel-build": "cd client && vite build"
  }
}
```

### vercel.json
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "client/dist"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/**/*.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/$1.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/client/dist/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment Verification

After deploying these changes, the application should:
- Successfully load the homepage without 404 errors
- Properly handle authentication via the `/api/authenticate` endpoint
- Serve the gift content via the `/api/claim` endpoint
- Allow users to submit replies via the `/api/reply` endpoint
- Display existing replies via the `/api/get-replies` endpoint

This configuration ensures that both the frontend React application and backend API endpoints work correctly in the Vercel serverless environment.
