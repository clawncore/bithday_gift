# Server Restore Summary

## Problem
The server was experiencing issues with:
1. Twilio dependencies causing conflicts
2. Corrupted package.json file with encoding issues
3. Missing dependencies preventing proper startup
4. Module resolution errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Twilio Dependencies
- Removed all Twilio-related code from server/routes.ts
- Removed Twilio from package.json dependencies
- Cleaned up all Twilio imports and functions
- Removed WhatsApp message sending functionality

### 2. Fixed Package.json Issues
- Created a clean package.json with proper UTF-8 encoding
- Installed only essential dependencies:
  - express
  - cors
  - dotenv
  - @supabase/supabase-js
  - @prisma/client
- Added proper development dependencies:
  - cross-env
  - tsx
  - typescript
  - @types/express
  - @types/node
  - @types/cors

### 3. Restored Server Files with Proper Encoding
- Recreated all server TypeScript files with proper UTF-8 encoding
- Fixed import statements and module references
- Ensured all files are readable and properly formatted

### 4. Verified Backend Routing
- Confirmed vercel.json is properly configured for backend-only routing
- Tested API endpoints to ensure proper functionality
- Verified CORS configuration

## API Endpoints Working

1. **POST /api/authenticate**
   - Authenticates with secret word "panda"
   - Returns success response when correct word is provided

2. **GET /api/claim**
   - Retrieves gift content
   - Tracks when gift is opened

3. **POST /api/reply**
   - Submits replies with choice and message
   - Stores replies in memory and database

4. **GET /api/get-replies**
   - Retrieves all stored replies
   - Returns replies in chronological order

## Testing Results
All API endpoints have been tested and are working correctly:
- Authentication with secret word "panda" ✓
- Gift claiming functionality ✓
- Reply submission ✓
- Reply retrieval ✓

## Server Status
- Server starts correctly on port 5015
- No module resolution errors
- All dependencies properly installed
- TypeScript compilation working for server files

## Next Steps
The server is now ready for:
1. Deployment to Vercel with proper backend routing
2. Integration with frontend components
3. Further development without Twilio dependencies

The server has been successfully restored to a clean state without Twilio dependencies and with all core functionality intact.
