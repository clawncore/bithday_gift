# Server Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was failing to deploy on Vercel with the error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/var/task/server/routes' imported from /var/task/server/vercel.js
```

This was happening because Vercel was trying to run TypeScript files directly without compiling them first.

## Solution
I've created JavaScript versions of all the server files to ensure proper module resolution in the Vercel environment:

1. Created `server/vercel.js` - JavaScript version of the entry point
2. Created `server/routes.js` - JavaScript version of the routes file
3. Created `server/storage.js` - JavaScript version of the storage file
4. Created `server/prismaClient.js` - JavaScript version of the Prisma client
5. Created `server/supabaseClient.js` - JavaScript version of the Supabase client

## Changes Made

### vercel.json
Updated to use the JavaScript entry point instead of TypeScript:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server/vercel.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node",
      "config": {
        "includeFiles": [
          "server/**/*.js",
          "shared/**/*"
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server/vercel.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server/vercel.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

### package.json
Updated the build:server script to avoid confusion:
```json
"build:server": "echo 'No separate server build needed'"
```

### Removed Files
Deleted `build-server.ts` as it's no longer needed with the JavaScript approach.

## How It Works
1. Vercel now uses `server/vercel.js` as the entry point
2. All imports use the `.js` extension for proper module resolution
3. The JavaScript files are included in the build through the `includeFiles` configuration
4. No separate compilation step is needed as Vercel can run the JavaScript files directly

## Testing
After deploying these changes, the application should:
1. Load the homepage correctly
2. Handle API requests properly
3. Display the timeline with all images
4. Process authentication and replies correctly

The error `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` should be resolved as all modules are now properly referenced with the correct extensions.
