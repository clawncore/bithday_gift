# Fixed Vercel Deployment

## Issue
The application was showing a "404 Not Found" error when deployed to Vercel because of incorrect configuration in the [vercel.json](file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/vercel.json) file.

## Root Cause
The main issue was that the Vercel configuration wasn't properly handling the build process and routing for a React + Express application. The original configuration was attempting to build from the root but serve files from an incorrect path.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated [vercel.json](file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/vercel.json) Configuration
- Configured the build to use `@vercel/static-build` with the correct `distDir` pointing to `client/dist`
- Set up proper routing for API endpoints to use `@vercel/node`
- Configured static file serving to correctly point to the built React app in `client/dist`

### 2. Updated package.json
- Added a `vercel-build` script that runs the build command from the root directory
- Ensured the build command properly navigates to the client directory and builds the React app

### 3. Verified API Endpoints
- Confirmed all API endpoints in the `/api` directory are properly structured for Vercel serverless functions
- Ensured each API file exports a default handler function as required by Vercel

## How It Works Now

1. Vercel runs the `vercel-build` script during deployment
2. This script builds the React frontend application into the `client/dist` directory
3. The static build configuration serves these files from the `client/dist` directory
4. API requests are routed to the appropriate serverless functions in the `/api` directory
5. All routes that don't match API endpoints serve the React application, enabling client-side routing

## Deployment Verification

After deploying these changes, the application should:
- Successfully load the homepage without 404 errors
- Properly handle authentication via the `/api/authenticate` endpoint
- Serve the gift content via the `/api/claim` endpoint
- Allow users to submit replies via the `/api/reply` endpoint
- Display existing replies via the `/api/get-replies` endpoint

This configuration ensures that both the frontend React application and backend API endpoints work correctly in the Vercel serverless environment.
