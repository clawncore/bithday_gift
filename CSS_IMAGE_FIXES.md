# CSS and Image Loading Fixes for Vercel Deployment

## Issues Identified

1. **Static Asset Routing**: The vercel.json routes were incorrectly configured to serve static files from `/dist/$1` instead of `/$1`
2. **Server Static File Serving**: The server/vercel.js was trying to serve static files from the dist directory, but on Vercel, static files are served directly
3. **Asset Availability**: Confirmed that images and other assets are correctly copied from client/public to dist during the build process

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated vercel.json Routing Configuration

**Before:**
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/$1",
      "methods": ["GET"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1",
      "methods": ["GET"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This change ensures that static assets like CSS files, images, and other resources are served from the correct location on Vercel.

### 2. Updated server/vercel.js Static File Handling

**Before:**
```javascript
// Serve static files from dist (root directory)
app.use(express.static("dist"));
```

**After:**
Removed static file serving from Express app since Vercel handles this directly.

### 3. Verified Asset Pipeline

Confirmed that:
- Images in `client/public/memories/` are correctly copied to `dist/memories/` during build
- CSS and JS assets are properly bundled and placed in `dist/assets/`
- The `index.html` file correctly references all assets with relative paths

## How It Works Now

1. **Vercel Static Asset Serving**: Vercel automatically serves all files in the dist directory directly
2. **API Routes**: API requests are handled by serverless functions
3. **SPA Routing**: Non-API requests are handled by the Express server which serves index.html
4. **Asset Loading**: All CSS, images, and JavaScript files are loaded correctly from their respective paths

## Expected Results

After deploying these changes, the application should:
- Load CSS styles correctly
- Display all images properly
- Play videos and audio files
- Maintain proper layout and design
- Function as intended with all visual elements

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix worked:
1. Check that `dist/memories/` directory contains all image files
2. Verify that CSS files are in `dist/assets/`
3. Confirm that `index.html` references assets with correct relative paths
4. Test deployment on Vercel to ensure all assets load properly
