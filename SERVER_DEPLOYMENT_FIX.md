# Server Deployment Fix for Vercel

## Issue
The application was showing a "404 Not Found" error when deployed to Vercel:
`GET https://bithday-gift.vercel.app/ 404 (Not Found)`

Additionally, there was a build error:
`Build Failed: Could not parse File as JSON: vercel.json`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The vercel.json file was missing a closing brace, causing JSON parsing errors
2. The server configuration wasn't properly included in the Vercel deployment
3. Path mismatches between where files were built and where the server expected to serve them

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed vercel.json Configuration
- Added the missing closing brace to make it valid JSON
- Included the server/vercel.ts file in the builds configuration
- Maintained proper routing for both API endpoints and static files

### 2. Updated server/vercel.ts
- Corrected the static file serving path from "client/dist" to "dist" to match the actual build output
- Ensured the server properly serves static files in production mode

### 3. Verified API Routes
- Confirmed that all API routes in server/routes.ts are properly configured
- Ensured error handling is in place for all endpoints

## How It Works Now

1. Vercel builds the React frontend application to the root "dist" directory
2. Vercel also builds and deploys the Express server defined in server/vercel.ts
3. The server serves static files from the "dist" directory
4. API requests are handled by the Express routes
5. All non-API requests serve the React application, enabling client-side routing

## Expected Result
After deploying these changes, the application should:
- Build successfully without JSON parsing errors
- Load the homepage without 404 errors
- Properly handle all client-side routing
- Successfully process API requests through the Express server
- Serve all static assets correctly

This configuration properly integrates both the frontend and backend components of the application for deployment on Vercel.
