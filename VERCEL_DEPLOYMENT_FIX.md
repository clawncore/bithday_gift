# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
The Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/var/task/server/routes' imported from /var/task/server/vercel.js
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that the [vercel.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/server/vercel.ts) file was trying to import the [routes.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/server/routes.ts) module, but this module was not available in the Vercel deployment environment. This was causing the entire server to crash on startup.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Simplified vercel.ts
Removed the import and usage of the [routes.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/server/routes.ts) module from [vercel.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/server/vercel.ts):
- Removed: `import { registerRoutes } from "./routes";`
- Removed: `registerRoutes(app).catch(error => { ... });`

### 2. Updated vercel.json routing
The [vercel.json](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/vercel.json) file was already correctly configured to route:
- `/api/*` requests to the serverless functions in the [api](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/api) directory
- All other requests to the Express server in [server/vercel.ts](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/server/vercel.ts)

### 3. Added proper path handling
Added proper path resolution using the `path` module to ensure static files are served correctly in the Vercel environment.

## How It Works Now
1. API requests (like `/api/authenticate`, `/api/claim`, etc.) are handled by the serverless functions in the [api](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/api) directory
2. All other requests (like the homepage, gift page, etc.) are handled by the Express server which serves the static frontend files
3. No complex module imports that could cause deployment issues

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Commit and push the changes to GitHub
2. Wait for Vercel to rebuild and deploy
3. Visit the deployment URL
4. Try accessing the homepage and gift page
5. Test the authentication with the secret word "panda"
6. Verify that all API endpoints work correctly

## Future Considerations
- Keep serverless functions in the [api](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/src/HappyBirthdayReel/api) directory simple and avoid complex imports
- Use environment variables properly in Vercel
- Test deployments thoroughly before considering them complete
