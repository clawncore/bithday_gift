# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
You're still seeing the error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/var/task/server/routes' imported from /var/task/server/vercel.js
```

## Root Cause Analysis
Despite our changes, Vercel is still trying to import the routes.ts module. This suggests that:

1. There might be some caching in the Vercel build process
2. The vercel.ts file might still be referenced somewhere in the build configuration
3. There might be some hidden references to the routes module

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Further Simplified vercel.ts
- Removed all imports except express
- Eliminated any code that could reference the routes module
- Kept only essential static file serving functionality

### 2. Simplified vercel.json
- Removed the server build configuration
- Using only "@vercel/static-build" for client builds
- Simplified routing to directly serve index.html for SPA routing

## Next Steps

### 1. Clear Vercel Cache
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to the "Settings" tab
4. Click on "Git" in the sidebar
5. Scroll down to "Ignored Build Step" and temporarily add a command to force a rebuild

### 2. Verify GitHub Repository
1. Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to GitHub
2. Verify that the vercel.ts file in GitHub doesn't contain any references to routes.ts
3. Check that the vercel.json file has been updated

### 3. Force a Clean Deployment
1. Create a new commit with a trivial change (like adding a comment)
2. Push to GitHub to trigger a new deployment
3. Monitor the build logs carefully

### 4. Check Build Logs
1. In the Vercel dashboard, go to the "Deployments" tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check the build logs for any references to server/routes or vercel.ts
4. Look for any errors during the build process

## Alternative Approach

If the issue persists, we can try an even simpler approach:

1. Remove the vercel.ts file entirely
2. Use only the static build approach
3. Handle all API requests through serverless functions

This would involve:
1. Deleting the server/vercel.ts file
2. Updating vercel.json to only include the static build configuration
3. Ensuring all API endpoints are handled by serverless functions in the api directory

## Expected Outcome

After these changes and a clean deployment:
1. The ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND error should be resolved
2. The client application should build and deploy correctly
3. The root route should load the homepage
4. All API endpoints should work through serverless functions
5. The application should function as expected

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit https://bithday-gift.vercel.app/
2. Verify the homepage loads correctly
3. Click "Reveal the Surprise"
4. Enter "panda" as the secret word
5. Verify you're redirected to the gift page
6. Test the reply form functionality
7. Check that all images load correctly
